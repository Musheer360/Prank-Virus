This is a malware (ransomware) simulation program written in VBScript.

Just download the zip file and extract it to the desired location (make sure the batch and VBS files are in the same folder)

Run the VBS file normally and get the show going.

PS: This script is totally harmless, it just restarts your computer into Advanced Startup menu when you reach to the end of the script.
You can simply click on continue to start your PC normally. You can exit the program through task manager.
